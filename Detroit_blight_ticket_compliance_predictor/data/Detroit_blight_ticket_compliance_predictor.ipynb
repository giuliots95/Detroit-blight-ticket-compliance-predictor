    "## Problem description\n",
    "Blight violation tickets are fines issued by several  public agencies to citizens or societies who allow their real estate to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues a lot of fines but many of these remain unpaid.\n",
    "Since the city wants aims to increase blight ticket compliance, a useful application would be a model that can predict how likely a violator will be compliant with blight ticket payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of uncompliant violator\n",
    "We have to define when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. A citizen has been defined uncompliant if the fine:\n",
    "- has not been payed entirely within 30 days after the hearing date\n",
    "- has not been payed at all\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by contrast, compliant violators are the ones who pay the total fine amount within the hearing date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blight ticket total amount\n",
    "The blight ticket total amount is composed by different fines and additional fees: the proper fine amount (violation fine amount, excluding fees), the admin_fee (20 USD fee assigned to responsible judgments), the state fee (10 USD fee assigned to responsible judgments), an additional late fee (10% fee assigned to responsible judgments if they exceed the payment date), a    discount_amount (a disount applied during judgment), the clean up cost (cost for clean-up or graffiti removal). All these items are summed in the so-called judgment amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required model performance\n",
    "The model predictions will be given as the probability (0-1) that the corresponding blight ticket will be paid on time.\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this assignment is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to build a binary classifier which AUROC score > 0.75."

    "## Data source\n",
    "Data used for this study come from Coursera \"Applied Machine Learning in Python\" - Assignement 4 - online repository. According to Coursera indications, they retrieved the dataset from the [Detroit Open Data Portal](https://data.detroitmi.gov/). \n",
    "Two datasets have been provided:\n",
    "- \"train.csv\" for model selection purpose\n",
    "- \"test.csv\" for testing the model predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "They have different number of columns, since the \"test.csv\" does not contain labelled data that are necessary to model scoring. In the original assigment by Coursera, the student has to submit the predictions obtained given the features stored in \"test.csv\", so test set \"true\" values were not directly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this study, I'm going to use only the \"train.csv\" file, splitting the whole dataset in a training and a validation set, due to the need of labelled data to evaluate the model classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset columns description\n",
    "Each row in the \"train.csv\" file corresponds to a single blight ticket, and includes information about when, why, and to whom each ticket was issued. The target variable is \"compliance\", which is True if the ticket was paid early, on time, or within one month of the hearing data, False if the ticket was paid after the hearing date or not at all, and Null if the violator was found not responsible during judgment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: \n",
    "* All tickets where the violators were found not responsible are not considered for this study.\n",
    "* \"train.csv\" contains all blight tickets issued from 2004 until 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"train.csv\" file contains following columns:\n",
    "train.csv & test.csv\n",
    "- ticket_id - unique identifier for tickets\n",
    "- agency_name - Agency that issued the ticket\n",
    "- inspector_name - Name of inspector that issued the ticket\n",
    "- violator_name - Name of the person/organization that the ticket was issued to\n",
    "- violation_street_number, violation_street_name, violation_zip_code - Address where the violation occurred\n",
    "- mailing_address_str_number, mailing_address_str_name, city, state, zip_code, non_us_str_code, country - Mailing address of the violator\n",
    "- ticket_issued_date - Date and time the ticket was issued\n",
    "- hearing_date - Date and time the violator's hearing was scheduled\n",
    "- violation_code, violation_description - Type of violation\n",
    "- disposition - Judgment and judgement type\n",
    "- fine_amount - Violation fine amount, excluding fees\n",

    "### Addresses files \n",
    "Coursera provides also 2 additional files, containing the \"right-spelled\" violation address and the latitude and longitude of each address. These csv files are:\n",
    "- \"addresses.csv\" maps the blight ticket to the corresponding address\n",
    "- \"latlons.csv\" maps the address to the corresponding lat and long coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "These file are practically used to map where the violation occurred. Note that with these additional files it is possible to use 2 numeric coordiantes, instead of the violation address, which is a much more complex data structure (you need to know the state, city, street name and number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in some cases mapping the blight violation address to the (lat, long) coordinates fails, due to errors in the transcriptions of the address. For this reason, \"unmapped\" tickets be filtered out from the dataset."
